# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This is a back-end project to start the creating of a server for WTWR application. In this includes working with databases, authentication for users, testing valiadtions, and also deploying web applications on a remote machine. The bigger picture in the end is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
